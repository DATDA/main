John The Ripper is one of the top hash-cracking utilities in the world. 
Its biggest strengths are its ease-of-use, and its password-generative abilities.
It's not as fast as Hashcat, but mainly the gap only exists in terms 
of GPUs now.

John has several main cracking modes:

Iterative -> Real Brute-Force. John can run forever in this mode.
Wordlist -> Dictionary attack. John runs through an arbitrarily large wordlist.

It also has many addons and flag features:

zip2john -> Allows John to crack encrypted zips
Rules -> Some say this is the most powerful feature of John. These can
	allow a user to sculpt exactly what type of passwords john should
	generate, including sculpting passwords based on a wordlist. It
	can be used in both iterative and wordlist mode. 
stdout -> John outputs guesses to the shell, allowing you to pipe John
	into any other program
	
Some examples of John:

Simple brute-forcing with John

> john passwords.txt

Wordlist mode with default rules

> john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --rules passwords.txt

Pipe a directory of wordlists into John

> ls ./folder_of_lists | xargs -t -I grabthefiles
	john --session=xargs --wordlist=./folder_of_lists/grabthefiles
	
Good Luck and Stay Legal!
