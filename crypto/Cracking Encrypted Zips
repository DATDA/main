There are a few different ways to crack an encrypted Zip file, some slow, fast, reliable, and not.

The first method (more reliable and faster) you should try is with the
jumbo versions of John the Ripper.

John comes with a handy utility, zip2john, that extracts the hashes from 
a zip so John can crack them. 

encrypted.zip -> normally encrypted zip
hashes_for.john -> new file to put the hashe(s) in

> zip2john encrypted.zip > hashes_for.john

Then just run john in any mode of your choosing on the hashes file.

wordlist.txt -> a wordlist hopefully containing the password

> john --wordlist=./wordlist.txt hashes_for.john

Done!

The second method is with a custom script. The Violent-Python book has
just such a script, though it's not nearly as reliable (many false-
positives). 

For now, you'll need to edit the script (zip_crack.py) to change
the wordlist and zip files. Once done, simply run it!

> python zip_crack.py

Done! (hopefully)

Good Luck and Stay Legal!
